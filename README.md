* The articles need a Title, a content or body, a picture and a corresponding category, selected through a select-box.

* The home webpage shows the latest articles by categories and full-width promo of the featured article. This featured achievement is accomplished if the article is the most voted.

* When a user clicks on a category, all the articles associated are shown.
